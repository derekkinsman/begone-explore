# Begone Explore

Twitter's _explore_ section is a dumpster fire. The What's Trending sidebar is full of conservative grandstanding, performative outrage, and disinformation bots. The actual Explore section is just that, but even more, and even worse. This Chrome Extension just gets rid of them via CSS. All the code is public so you can verify that I'm not attempting unlawful nincompoopery.
